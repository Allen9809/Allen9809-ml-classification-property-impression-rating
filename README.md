## Project Overview
This project aimed to develop a predictive model for a specific use case, focusing on population mobility prediction based on census and geographical data. The project involved several stages including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, fine-tuning, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories:

1. `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets used in the project.
2. `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
3. `models/`: Saved model artifacts.
4. `scripts/`: Utility scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
5. `docs/`: Documentation files including this README.md.

## Setup Instructions
To reproduce the project's results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and execute the Jupyter notebooks in the following order:
- Data Exploration.ipynb
- Data Preprocessing.ipynb
- Model Training and Evaluation.ipynb

4. Alternatively, you can run the scripts in the `scripts/` directory directly from the command line:

## Key Findings
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed important insights into the dataset.
- Feature engineering improved the predictive power of the models.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest models were chosen for their performance and interpretability.
- Model evaluation yielded classification accuracies of 72.8% and 73.5%, respectively.

## Challenges and Limitations
- Assumption validation required consultation with domain experts due to lack of business domain knowledge.
- Limited geographical data coverage posed challenges in population mobility prediction.
- Time constraints hindered extensive grid search and model interpretation efforts.
- Interpretation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models was challenging due to their black-box nature.

## Conclusion
The project successfully developed predictive models for population mobility prediction, achieving satisfactory performance given the constraints. Further improvements could be made with domain expert consultation, more comprehensive feature engineering, and additional model fine-tuning. Deployment and MLOps operations such as model monitoring and drift detection are recommended for future steps.
