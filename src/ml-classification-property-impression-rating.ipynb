    "### Interpretations of key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TotalSqFt (0.184108) and NumFloors (0.175815):**\n",
    "   - Larger storage facilities with more floors can accommodate more goods, attracting tenants who require significant storage space. This increased capacity and flexibility can lead to higher demand and, consequently, higher rental rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SP500_Close (0.133907) and DJIA_Close (0.130864):**\n",
    "   - Economic stability and growth, reflected in the performance of indices like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, often correlate with increased demand for storage space. Businesses expanding their operations or individuals moving due to economic factors may require storage facilities, impacting rental rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TotalAcres (0.077365) and NumBuildings (0.067186):**\n",
    "   - Similarly, larger total acres and more buildings within a storage facility complex indicate a larger overall capacity and variety of storage options. This versatility appeals to a broader range of tenants, potentially increasing demand and rental rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **pop_mobility_state (0.066812):**\n",
    "   - Population mobility at the state level may reflect economic activity and population growth within a region. Increased mobility can lead to more businesses relocating or individuals moving, potentially driving up demand for storage space and influencing rental rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **PropertyName_others (0.047685):**\n",
    "   - The inclusion of various storage facility brands not explicitly listed suggests that brand or reputation could also impact rental rates. Well-known brands or facilities with a positive reputation may command higher rental rates due to perceived quality or trustworthiness.\n"

    "Due to computational constraints, a random subset of 100 samples was chosen for SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) value calculation. While this subset strikes a balance between computational cost and analysis depth, larger subsets may offer more comprehensive insights into feature importance. After all, due to random sampling,  this subset is expected to be somewhat representative of the overall dataset."

    "### 1. **Assumption Validation:** \n",
    " - Ensuring logical and correct assumptions, including column definitions, is critical for this use case. Lack of business domain knowledge underscores the need for consultation with domain experts to establish these assumptions collaboratively in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Geographical Data Utilization Limitation:** \n",
    " - I utilized census population statistics to calculate population mobility, mapping it as a feature in my dataset. However, ertain cities were not adequately covered by the data. I noticed that some premium datasets offer more standardized structures and broader data coverage, potentially addressing these gaps. Additionally, while merging data, I relied on city and state names. Utilizing zip codes for mapping in premium datasets could offer a more accurate and convenient approach, enhancing scalability and sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Time Constraint Challenges:** \n",
    " - Due to time constraints, I was unable to explore an extensive grid search during the fine-tuning process. Instead, I relied on my experience to narrow down the parameter space. Furthermore, I selected conventional models for experimentation to expedite the process. However, a more detailed examination of internal data relationships and feature engineering might warrant the application of more complex classification models such as Neural Networks, which is possible to uncover latent patterns within the data, potentially leading to enhancements in performance.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Model Interpretation Challenges:**\n",
    " - The nature of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models poses challenges in interpretation due to their inherent black-box nature. Attempts were made to utilize the SHAP library to approximate feature importances. However, processing SHAP values took an impractical amount of time. Given more time, an alternative approach would involve training a baseline SVM model separately and manually reducing dimensionality by selecting only the most crucial features for training. This approach would streamline the process of computing SHAP values, making it more efficient and feasible for interpretation purposes.\n",

    "Firstly, I successfully conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the dataset, **engineered features** from existing columns, and **merged two external datasets** based on timestamps and geographical locations to create new features. From my model pool, I selected **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Random Forest** as candidate models for further **grid search fine-tuning**. Each model's performance was assessed using **cross-validation** to avoid overfitting. Finally, I evaluated the models using holdout data and interpreted their outputs based on **feature importance**. The **classification accuracy** of the two models reached **72.8% and 73.5%**, respectively. Given the limited time and my lack of extensive background knowledge of the dataset, I consider this performance satisfactory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further improvements in **feature engineering** could be made after the consultation with business domain experts. The next steps involve **model deployment** and implementing a series of **MLOps operations** such as **model monitoring, automation, and drift detection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am grateful for the opportunity provided, and I found working on this project to be enjoyable. I am enthusiastic about conducting similar projects in the future. Thank you for taking the time to review. Have a good day~!\n"
